# TypeScript vs. JavaScript: Key differences and advantages.

| **Aspect**               | **JavaScript (JS)**                                                                                  | **TypeScript (TS)**                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type System**          | Dynamically typed: No need to declare variable types explicitly.                                     | Statically typed: Requires or infers variable types, catching errors during development.             |
| **Error Checking**       | Errors are detected during runtime.                                                                  | Provides compile-time error checking, reducing runtime bugs.                                         |
| **Tooling & IDE Support**| Limited intellisense and autocompletion due to lack of type information.                             | Offers rich intellisense, refactoring tools, and error detection in supported IDEs.                  |
| **Ease of Use**          | Beginner-friendly, requires no setup or compilation.                                                 | Steeper learning curve due to type annotations and configuration but ideal for maintainable code.    |
| **Compatibility**        | Runs directly in browsers or Node.js without preprocessing.                                          | Must be compiled to JavaScript using tools like `tsc` before running.                                |
| **Features**             | Supports modern ES features with polyfills, no additional capabilities beyond JavaScript.            | Includes JavaScript features plus interfaces, enums, generics, and advanced type-checking.           |
| **Community**            | Larger community with vast libraries and frameworks.                                                 | Rapidly growing community; most major libraries and frameworks support TypeScript.                   |
| **Use Cases**            | Quick prototypes, small projects, or when working with legacy code.                                  | Large-scale, team-based, or long-term projects requiring type safety and maintainability.            |
